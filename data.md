# The Data

The proposed solution will make use of the [Foursquare location data](https://developer.foursquare.com/places) to find the venues and their geographical location.

The [Foursquare Places](https://developer.foursquare.com/places) service provides us, throught its API, a tool for location discovery
> 62M+ Global Venues, 190+ Countries and 50 Territories, 900+ Venue Categories, and, 30+ Attribute Fields (Foursquare developers, 2020)

The data retrieved comes with geographical coordinates for each venue retrieved, and can be filtered by categories.

It is with these information, that we seek for geographical clusters of all the venues and report a score according how close and how many venues are on each cluster found.
